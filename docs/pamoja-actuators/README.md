# pamoja-actuators

Generated from rustdoc by `cargo xtask docs` - do not edit by hand.

Concrete actuator drivers for the pamoja SDK.

Where [`pamoja-sensors`](https://docs.rs/pamoja-sensors) decodes what a part
reports, this crate encodes what a part should do: it turns a desired output (a
PWM frequency and duty, a servo angle, a motor step) into the exact register bytes
or coil pattern a driver writes to the hardware. Like the rest of the SDK's
hardware crates, it is the command half ahead of the actual bus driver, pure logic
with no I/O, so the same code runs on a microcontroller and in a test.

- [`pca9685`] - the NXP PCA9685 16-channel 12-bit PWM controller, the common way
  to drive servos, dimmable LEDs, and motor-driver inputs over I2C. Its register
  map, prescale formula, and channel words follow the datasheet.
- [`stepper`] - coil sequencing for four-wire stepper motors: the wave, full-step,
  and half-step drive patterns, plus a step-and-direction position model for
  driver chips that take a step pulse and a direction level.

Simple on/off actuators (relays, solenoid valves, a pump switched through a
transistor) need no driver of their own: they are a GPIO line, modelled by the pin
and logic-level types in [`pamoja-gpio`](https://docs.rs/pamoja-gpio).
