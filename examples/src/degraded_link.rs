//! Offline-first store-and-forward over a flaky link, run end to end.
//!
//! This is the resilience conformance scenario: a field node buffers its readings in a
//! durable queue and keeps trying to forward the backlog over a link that is reachable
//! only part of the time. A degraded send leaves the record and the rest queued, in order,
//! so the backlog rises while the link is down and falls when it returns, and once the
//! link has cycled enough every reading has reached the gateway in order with nothing lost.
//! The run returns what it observed, so a test can assert offline-first held and an example
//! can narrate the backlog rising and falling.
//!
//! It composes `pamoja-sim`'s degraded link with `pamoja-sync` store-and-forward,
//! `pamoja-codec`, and `pamoja-loopback`, with no hardware and no broker.
