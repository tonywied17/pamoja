//! A device profile assembled into a ready-to-run cold-chain node, over loopback.
//!
//! A builder picks the `vaccine-fridge-monitor` profile and hands it a sensor, a
//! cooler relay, an in-process link, and a codec. The assembled node does the rest:
//! each cycle it reads the probe, decides with the profile's controller, switches the
//! cooler, and publishes the reading to a gateway, which decodes it. A door left open
//! pushes the temperature into the danger zone and the node raises an excursion
//! alert; as the simulated battery sags, the node reports a longer wait before the
//! next sample. No hardware, no broker. This composes six crates - `pamoja-profile`,
//! `pamoja-kit` and `pamoja-power` (through the profile), `pamoja-codec`,
//! `pamoja-loopback`, and `pamoja-sim` for the fake probe and relay - through the
//! same shapes every binding exposes.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo run -p pamoja-examples --example device_profile`
