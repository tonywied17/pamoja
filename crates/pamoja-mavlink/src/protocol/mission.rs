//! The mission (plan) transfer protocol.
//!
//! A plan is transferred one item at a time, driven entirely by the receiver: the receiver
//! announces or is told the item count, then requests item 0, item 1, and so on, and the
//! sender answers each request with the matching [`MissionItemInt`]. The transfer ends with a
//! [`MissionAck`]. Items must arrive in order; an out-of-order item is dropped and the expected
//! sequence number is re-requested.
//!
//! The two roles are symmetric, so this module models them as two machines rather than by
//! direction: a [`MissionSender`] holds the items and answers requests, and a
//! [`MissionReceiver`] asks for items and collects them. A ground station uploading a plan is a
//! sender talking to a vehicle receiver; a ground station downloading a plan is a receiver
//! talking to a vehicle sender. The same two machines cover both, and neither allocates: the
//! sender borrows the item slice, and the receiver hands each item back to the caller instead
//! of storing them.
