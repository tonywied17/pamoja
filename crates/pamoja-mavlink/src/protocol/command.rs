//! The command protocol: send a command and interpret its acknowledgement.
//!
//! A ground station sends a [`CommandLong`](crate::dialect::CommandLong) (or
//! [`CommandInt`](crate::dialect::CommandInt)) and waits for a
//! [`CommandAck`](crate::dialect::CommandAck) carrying the same command id. The
//! acknowledgement's result may be
//! [`IN_PROGRESS`](crate::dialect::mav_result::IN_PROGRESS), which means a long-running
//! command is still executing and the sender should keep waiting rather than time out. If no
//! acknowledgement arrives, the command is resent with an incremented `confirmation` count,
//! up to a retry limit, exactly as the protocol prescribes.
//!
//! [`CommandProtocol`] holds that logic: it matches acknowledgements to the command in flight,
//! classifies each into an [`AckOutcome`], and tracks the `confirmation` count and remaining
//! retries. It performs no IO; the caller sends the messages and applies the timeout.
