//! The error model for the MAVLink wire layer.

//! A single [`MavlinkError`] keeps framing, checksum, and signing faults uniform, the
//! way [`pamoja-modbus`](https://docs.rs/pamoja-modbus) and
//! [`pamoja-lorawan`](https://docs.rs/pamoja-lorawan) each carry their own protocol
//! error type ahead of the transport layer.
