//! The typed message layer: a broad slice of the MAVLink common dialect, plus the seam
//! that lets any message id be carried and checked.
//!
//! A [`Frame`](crate::Frame) moves opaque payload bytes; this module gives those bytes
//! meaning. Each typed message knows its id, its `CRC_EXTRA` seed, and how its fields are
//! laid out on the wire, so a sender fills named fields instead of hand-packing a buffer
//! and a receiver reads them back. The set covers what a ground station and an autopilot
//! actually exchange: the periodic [`Heartbeat`], system status, the command, parameter,
//! and mission protocols, and the core position and attitude telemetry.
//!
//! Messages are declared from one source of truth and their byte layout is derived from
//! it, including the field reordering MAVLink applies (largest field first). Each message
//! carries the official `CRC_EXTRA` for its shape, and a test re-derives that seed from
//! the field definitions, so a wrong field type, name, or order is caught against the
//! published dialect rather than only by a round-trip.
//!
//! Only a message's base fields are modeled; MAVLink 2 extension fields are not yet
//! surfaced. Because the checksum excludes extension fields, decoding a frame that carries
//! them still verifies and reads its base fields correctly. A message this slice does not
//! type can still be carried as a [`RawMessage`].
