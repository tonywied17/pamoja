//! Concrete sensor drivers for the pamoja SDK.
//!
//! [`pamoja-gpio`](https://docs.rs/pamoja-gpio) builds the address and mode bytes a
//! controller puts on an I2C or SPI bus; this crate is the layer just above it, the
//! per-part knowledge that turns the raw register bytes a specific sensor returns
//! into a physical reading. Each module is one named part: it knows that part's
//! register map, builds the bytes that configure it, and decodes what it sends back,
//! applying the exact conversion the manufacturer's datasheet specifies.
//!
//! Like the rest of the SDK's hardware crates, these are the decode-and-configure
//! half ahead of the actual bus driver: pure logic with no I/O, so the same code runs
//! on a microcontroller and in a test. A caller pairs a module here with whatever
//! performs the transfers (a `pamoja-gpio` Linux backend, an `embedded-hal` bus, or a
//! simulator) and gets calibrated readings without re-deriving a datasheet.
//!
//! The conversions are anchored to each datasheet's own reference values, since they
//! are where memory-driven bugs hide. The BME280 compensation is ported from Bosch's
//! published reference code and cross-checked against its floating-point form; the
//! DS18B20 decode is pinned to the datasheet's temperature/data table and its CRC to
//! the Maxim 1-Wire polynomial; the INA219 math is checked against the datasheet's
//! worked design example; the ADS1115 full-scale conversion against its per-gain LSB
//! sizes.
//!
//! - [`bme280`] - Bosch temperature, pressure, and humidity over I2C or SPI.
//! - [`ds18b20`] - Maxim 1-Wire digital thermometer, with CRC-checked scratchpads.
//! - [`ina219`] - Texas Instruments high-side current, voltage, and power monitor.
//! - [`ads1115`] - Texas Instruments 16-bit I2C analog-to-digital converter.
