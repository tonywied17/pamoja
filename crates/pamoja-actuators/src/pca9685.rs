//! NXP PCA9685 16-channel, 12-bit PWM controller.
//!
//! The PCA9685 drives sixteen independent PWM outputs at one shared frequency, which
//! is what makes it the usual way to run a bank of servos, dimmable LEDs, or the
//! speed and direction inputs of motor drivers from a single I2C device. This module
//! builds the values that program it: the prescaler that sets the output frequency,
//! the address of each channel's registers, and the 12-bit on/off word that sets a
//! channel's phase and duty, with the full-on and full-off encodings the datasheet
//! defines.
//!
//! It is pure logic: a caller writes the bytes to the device over whatever performs
//! the I2C transfers.

/// The PCA9685 register addresses.
