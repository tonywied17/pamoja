//! Coil sequencing for four-wire stepper motors.
//!
//! A stepper turns by energising its coils in a repeating pattern; stepping through
//! the pattern in one direction or the other advances or reverses the shaft. This
//! module holds the three standard drive patterns and a sequencer that walks them, so
//! a caller toggles the four coil lines (directly, or through a darlington array like
//! the ULN2003) without hand-maintaining the sequence. It also models the
//! step-and-direction interface of driver chips such as the A4988 and DRV8825, which
//! take a step pulse and a direction level and track position as a signed count.
//!
//! Coil patterns are four bits, the most significant being the first coil (IN1 on a
//! ULN2003 board) down to the least significant (IN4).

/// Which way to step.
